# 📘 Welcome to the IS Project Documentation Template!

Hey there! 👋

This repository is your home for documenting your **Innovation School Project** and starting your **maker portfolio**.  
You’ll be using the **GitHub Wiki** to update all your project details in a structured format.

## 🧠 What to Do First

Start by writing a **brief introduction** to your project right here in this `README.md` file:

🔹 What problem are you solving? 
    The major problem targeted to people in stress inducing environments (that are prone to heart attacks) is that there are a lot of heart related issues that can be left unchecked. While there are products that measure the user's heart rate, they are generally unaware if that heart rate is health or not, and whether it needs to be checked or not. 

🔹 What’s your proposed solution?
    Our solution is a product that the user can wear on their wrist. It detects the user's heart rate and changes color based on whether the heart rate is healthy or not. If the heart rate is unhealthy for an extended period of time, the user is alerted through vibrations.

Just 2–3 lines are enough. This helps others quickly understand what your project is about.

Click on the ✏️ PENCIL icon next to the README title above, and you can edit the README directly from within your browser.

## 🛠 Where to Document Everything Else

We’ve already created a standard set of [**Wiki pages**](https://github.com/MakersAsylumIndia/Bowl-Buddy/wiki) for your project in this repository — you just need to **update them with your project information**.

Each section is ready with headings like:

- Project Title
- Problem Statement
- Bill of Materials (BOM)
- Solution Overview
- SDG Goals Associated
- Circuit & CAD Files
- Media Gallery
- License
